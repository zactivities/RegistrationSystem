My solution correctly adds and prints
students, faculty, subjects, courses and sections. The only extra class I
included was the UndergradStudent class and I created another class
because unlike other student types, undergraduates have a student year. All 
other information for undergraduates is inherited from student and person.

When creating the Person class and the classes that inherit from Person, I made 
the assumption that after a Person has been created, first name, last name,
email and ID should not be available to change and email can either be passed in
or automatically generated. With the Student class, I assumed that students
should be able to change their type, program, advisor and start quarter based
on my own experience as a student. With the Faculty, I assumed faculty type, 
building and room were subject to change and included setters.
